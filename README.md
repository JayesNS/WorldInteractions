# WorldInteractions

This project is unofficial continuation of [Modifyworld Plugin](https://github.com/PEXPlugins/Modifyworld)
written by [t3hk0d3](https://github.com/t3hk0d3). Modifyworld is no longer supported and doesn't work on newer
versions of Spigot server. Most of original code was replaced with new one which works on newer versions of Spigot (1.15+) 

### Wiki

All available information on how to configure this plugin is described in [Wiki](https://github.com/JayesNS/WorldInteractions/wiki) (in progress)

### Notes

This plugin is still in development. I can't guarantee that everything will work perfectly. It definitely needs much more
testing before it will be ready to production use. All help will be appreciated especially with testing and coding. I'm
new to Java development so I'm open to every suggestion on how to improve this plugin.
